This repo contains analysis for the Educ 863 final paper.

## Dataset

This dataset is downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics). Based on the metadata, it contains the following features so this seems to line up with what we observed so far in terms of data types (e.g., math score is an integer data type).

* Gender: The gender of the student (male/female)
* Race/ethnicity: The student's racial or ethnic background (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, etc.)

* Reading score: The student's score on a standardized reading test
* Writing score: The student's score on a standardized writing test

## Research question

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether parental educational attainment has an impact on high school students' mathematics achievement measured by math scores of a standardized test.
